My partner and I loved the intimate experience and every wine on the menu. If you're looking for an authentic experience with an amazing host, look no further. Sean's local rapport with all the cellar door owners really helps to build the experience even more. We also experienced some above and beyond personal touches to come home with (I won't spoil it).. Sean is the best. Thanks for a great experience.",

He made a genuine effort to get to know each of us on a personal level, and took us to the smaller, family owned vineyards which are so incredibly important to support - particularly during these times. You wouldn’t get an experience like this with a large, corporate type organisation. There were a few very generous touches and surprises I won’t spoil, but would highly recommend this tour; it was the highlight of our hunter trip! Would do the tour again in a heartbeat.",
